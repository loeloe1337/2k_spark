# Data Directory

This directory contains data files used by the 2K Spark project.

## Structure

- `raw/`: Contains raw data fetched from the API
  - `standings.json`: Player standings data
  - `recent_matches.json`: Recent match data
  - `schedule_data.json`: Schedule data for matches
  
- `processed/`: Contains processed data ready for use in prediction models
  - This directory will be populated with processed data files as the project progresses

## Usage

Data files in this directory are automatically generated by the scripts in the `examples/` and `scripts/` directories. You should not need to manually modify these files.

## Notes

- Data files in this directory are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`
- The `raw/` directory contains data directly from the API
- The `processed/` directory will contain data that has been cleaned, transformed, and prepared for use in prediction models
