# Processed Data

This directory will contain processed data ready for use in prediction models.

## Purpose

The processed data directory is intended to store data that has been:
- Cleaned (e.g., missing values handled, outliers addressed)
- Transformed (e.g., feature engineering, normalization)
- Prepared for use in prediction models

## Future Files

As the project progresses, this directory will be populated with files such as:
- `player_features.json`: Engineered features for each player
- `match_features.json`: Engineered features for each match
- `training_data.json`: Data prepared for training prediction models
- `validation_data.json`: Data prepared for validating prediction models

## Notes

- These files will be automatically generated by data processing scripts
- Do not manually modify these files
- These files are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`
