## What Works
- Project initialization and planning
- Backend foundation and architecture
- Data fetching and processing with real H2H GG League API data
- Advanced player statistics calculation with derived metrics
- Feature engineering module with variance, momentum, and recent form metrics
- Cross-validated winner prediction model with feature selection
- Score prediction model with low MAE and feature selection
- Bayesian optimization for model hyperparameter tuning
- Model registry with maintenance tools
- API server with all necessary endpoints
- Service layer for data, predictions, and refresh operations
- Frontend foundation with Next.js and Shadcn UI
- API client for frontend-backend communication
- Frontend pages and components
- Data visualization components

## What's Left to Build
- Comprehensive testing suite for backend and frontend
- UI improvements with better spacing and alignment
- Complete dark mode implementation
- Enhanced data visualizations
- Documentation completion
- Deployment process
- CI/CD pipeline

## Current Status
Project is in the Model Refinement and Validation phase. We have implemented the backend foundation, data components, advanced prediction models with feature engineering, API server, and frontend components. We've also added cross-validation, feature selection, and Bayesian optimization to improve model performance. Next steps are to implement comprehensive testing, improve the UI with better spacing and alignment, and prepare for deployment.

## Known Issues
- Winner prediction model previously showed misleading 100% accuracy due to small test set (fixed)
- Limited automated tests implemented
- UI spacing and alignment needs improvement
- No deployment process or CI/CD pipeline in place
- File-based storage may have scalability limitations
