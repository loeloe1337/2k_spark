## What Works
- Project initialization and planning
- Backend foundation and architecture
- Data fetching and processing
- Prediction models
- API server with endpoints
- Service layer for data, predictions, and refresh operations
- Frontend foundation with Next.js and Shadcn UI
- API client for frontend-backend communication
- Frontend pages and components
- Data visualization components

## What's Left to Build
- Integration testing between frontend and backend
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Documentation
- Deployment process
- CI/CD pipeline

## Current Status
Project is in the integration and enhancement phase. We have implemented the backend foundation, data components, prediction models, API server, and frontend components. Next steps are to test the integration between frontend and backend, implement end-to-end workflow, and add comprehensive testing.

## Known Issues
- No testing implemented yet
- No end-to-end workflow testing
- No deployment process
- No CI/CD pipeline
