# 2K Flash Project Brief

## Project Overview
2K Flash is an NBA 2K25 eSports Match Prediction System designed to provide accurate predictions for upcoming matches in the H2H GG League. The system collects data from the H2H GG League API, processes player statistics, and uses machine learning models to predict match winners and scores.

## Core Requirements
1. Fetch match data from the H2H GG League API
2. Calculate comprehensive player statistics
3. Train and optimize prediction models for match winners and scores
4. Provide a user-friendly interface for viewing predictions
5. Implement automated data refresh and prediction updates

## Project Goals
1. Implement a clean, modular architecture
2. Improve code organization and maintainability
3. Enhance error handling and logging
4. Add comprehensive testing
5. Implement proper configuration management
6. Improve documentation
7. Streamline deployment process
8. Enhance user experience
9. Maintain all existing functionality

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Python with Flask for API
- **Frontend**: Next.js with Shadcn UI components
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Data Processing**: NumPy, Pandas
- **Web Scraping**: Selenium (for token retrieval)
- **Model Optimization**: scikit-optimize

## Key Features
1. **Data Collection**
   - Authentication token retrieval from H2H GG League
   - Historical match data fetching
   - Upcoming match data retrieval
   - Player statistics calculation

2. **Prediction Models**
   - Winner prediction model
   - Score prediction model
   - Model optimization and tuning
   - Model registry and versioning

3. **User Interface**
   - Match predictions display
   - Score predictions with point differentials
   - Prediction history tracking
   - Statistics and metrics visualization
   - Filtering and sorting capabilities

4. **Automation**
   - End-to-end prediction pipeline
   - Automated data refresh
   - Scheduled prediction updates

## Timeline
The project will be implemented in four phases:
1. Foundation and Architecture
2. Core Functionality
3. Integration and Enhancement
4. Finalization and Deployment

## Success Criteria
- All existing functionality is preserved
- Code is well-organized and maintainable
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Improved user experience
- Streamlined deployment process
