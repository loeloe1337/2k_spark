This folder contains configuration files and settings for the backend application. It centralizes all configuration management, making it easy to adjust application behavior and environment settings.

- `logging_config.py`: Contains the logging configuration for the backend services, specifying log formats, handlers, and log levels to ensure consistent and manageable logging across the application.
- `settings.py`: Manages application settings, environment variables, and configuration parameters, providing a single source of truth for runtime configuration.

The `config` folder ensures that configuration and logging are organized and easily maintainable, supporting robust and flexible application deployment.
