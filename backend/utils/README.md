# utils

This folder contains utility modules for the backend application. These modules provide reusable helper functions and classes that support various parts of the codebase.

- `logging.py`: Utility functions for setting up and managing logging, ensuring consistent log output across modules.
- `time.py`: Time-related utilities, such as formatting, parsing, and manipulating timestamps and durations.
- `validation.py`: Data validation utilities, used to check the integrity and correctness of data inputs and outputs.

The `utils` folder helps keep the codebase DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) by centralizing common functionality, making the backend easier to maintain and extend.
