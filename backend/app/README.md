# app

This folder contains the main application logic for the backend. It includes modules for API endpoints, command-line tools, and data exploration scripts.

- `api.py`: Defines the FastAPI endpoints and routes for the backend service, handling HTTP requests and responses.
- `cli.py`: Provides command-line interface utilities for interacting with the backend, such as running jobs or administrative tasks.
- `fetch_data_explore.py`: Contains scripts and functions for fetching, exploring, and analyzing data, often used for data ingestion or prototyping.

The `app` folder serves as the entry point for both API and CLI operations, acting as the main interface for external interactions with the backend system.
