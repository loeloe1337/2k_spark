- **New Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/run-pipeline` - Full pipeline as background job
  - `POST /api/data/quick-refresh` - Fast data refresh job
  - `POST /api/ml/generate-predictions` - Prediction generation job
  - `POST /api/ml/train` - Model training job
  - `GET /api/system/health` - System health check
  - `GET /api/system/health/history` - Health history
  - `GET /api/jobs` - List all jobs
  - `GET /api/jobs/{job_id}` - Get job status
  - `POST /api/jobs/{job_id}/cancel` - Cancel job
  - `DELETE /api/jobs/cleanup` - Cleanup old jobs

### 7. Render Cloud Optimizations ✅
- **Timeout Prevention**: All operations < 5 minutes using job system
- **Resource Awareness**: Memory and CPU optimized for cloud constraints
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized database connections
- **Storage Integration**: Models and data stored in Supabase
- **Health Checks**: Render-compatible health endpoints
- **Environment Variables**: Proper configuration for cloud deployment

## Architecture Benefits

- Database-first approach ensures data consistency
- Stateless API design for cloud deployment

### Reliability  
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Job retry mechanisms and cleanup
- Health monitoring and alerting
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

### Performance
- Optimized database queries with proper indexing
- Resource-aware processing for cloud constraints
- Caching and data reuse where appropriate
- Early stopping and timeout protection

### Monitoring
- Real-time job progress tracking
- System health monitoring
- Performance metrics collection
- Historical data for troubleshooting

## API Usage Examples

### Start Full Pipeline
```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-app.onrender.com/api/run-pipeline" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "history_days": 30,
    "train_model": true,
    "return_predictions": true,
    "refresh_token": false
  }'
```

### Quick Data Refresh
```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-app.onrender.com/api/data/quick-refresh?refresh_token=false&return_predictions=true"
```

### Check Job Status
```bash
curl "https://your-app.onrender.com/api/jobs/{job_id}"
```

### System Health Check
```bash
curl "https://your-app.onrender.com/api/system/health"
```

### Train New Model
```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-app.onrender.com/api/ml/train?days_back=30&min_matches_per_player=3"
```

## Deployment Instructions

### Render Setup
1. Connect GitHub repository to Render
2. Use Python 3.11 runtime
3. Set build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Set start command: `uvicorn backend.app.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
5. Configure environment variables (see render.yaml)
6. Set health check URL: `/api/health`

### Environment Variables
```
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_key
API_HOST=0.0.0.0
API_PORT=$PORT
CORS_ORIGINS=["*"]
```

### Database Setup
Database migrations are applied automatically via Supabase. The following tables will be created:
- job_queue
- pipeline_jobs
- system_health
- model_registry
- matches
- player_stats
- upcoming_matches
- match_predictions
- model_performance
- feature_importance

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. **Daily**: Check system health via `/api/system/health`
2. **Weekly**: Review job statistics and cleanup old jobs
3. **Monthly**: Review model performance and retrain if needed
4. **Quarterly**: Database optimization and index maintenance

### Alerts and Monitoring
- Set up alerts for failed jobs
- Monitor system resources via health endpoints
- Track model performance degradation
- Monitor data freshness

### Troubleshooting
1. Check job status for any failures
2. Review system health for resource issues
3. Check logs for specific error details
4. Use job retry mechanisms for transient failures

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Response Times
- Health check: < 1 second
- Job creation: < 2 seconds
- Quick data refresh: 2-5 minutes
- Full pipeline: 5-15 minutes
- Model training: 3-8 minutes

### Resource Usage
- Memory: 256-512 MB typical, 1GB during training
- CPU: Low usage except during training/processing
- Database: ~100 queries per pipeline run
- Storage: Models ~10-50MB each

## Security Considerations
- All API keys stored as environment variables
- Database access via service role key
- CORS configured for specific origins
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Error messages sanitized to prevent information leakage

## Future Enhancements
1. **Distributed Job Processing**: Multiple worker instances
2. **Advanced Monitoring**: Metrics dashboard
3. **Auto-scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation
4. **Model A/B Testing**: Automatic model comparison
5. **Real-time Predictions**: WebSocket support
6. **Advanced Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed data

## Conclusion
The system is now production-ready with comprehensive job management, health monitoring, and cloud optimizations. All long-running operations are handled via the background job system to prevent timeouts, and the architecture is designed for scalability and reliability on Render platform.
