Of course. Setting up Docker and Supabase will create a robust, scalable, and portable environment for your project.

I recommend starting with **Docker first**. By containerizing your existing FastAPI application, we'll establish a consistent and isolated environment. This simplifies dependency management and makes the subsequent integration with Supabase much cleaner.

Here is the proposed plan:

### **Phase 1: Dockerize the FastAPI Application**

1.  **Create a `Dockerfile`**: We will add a `Dockerfile` to the root of your project to define the container image for your Python backend. It will handle installing dependencies from `requirements.txt` and configure the command to run your FastAPI server.
2.  **Create a `.dockerignore` file**: To keep the Docker image lean, we'll add a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files and directories like .venv, `__pycache__`, and logs.
3.  **Create a `docker-compose.yml` file**: This file will make it easy to run your application and any other services. We'll define a backend service that builds from your `Dockerfile`, maps ports, and uses volumes to mount your code for live-reloading during development. We will also mount the output and logs directories to persist data.
4.  **Update Documentation**: We'll update your `README.md` with instructions on how to build and run the project using Docker.

### **Phase 2: Integrate Supabase**

1.  **Confirm Supabase Project Details**: Your VS Code settings include a Supabase project reference (`sjlqonaqpvnqonmsnabk`) and an access token. We'll first confirm if this is the correct project for `2k_spark`. Then, I'll help you locate the Project URL and keys from your Supabase dashboard.
2.  **Define Database Schema**: Based on the structure of your current JSON files (`match_history.json`, `player_stats.json`, etc.), we will design and create the necessary tables in your Supabase database (e.g., `matches`, `players`, `stats`).
3.  **Update Python Code**: We will refactor the application to communicate with Supabase instead of local JSON files.
    *   Add the `supabase-py` library to requirements.txt.
    *   Create a new service to manage the Supabase client connection.
    *   Update the `DataService` to perform database operations (CRUD) on the Supabase tables.
4.  **Create a Data Migration Script**: We'll write a simple, one-time script to read the data from your existing `.json` files and upload it to your new Supabase tables.
5.  **Update Docker Configuration**: We will securely pass your Supabase credentials (URL and Key) to the backend container as environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

This phased approach ensures we tackle one major component at a time, starting with a solid foundation.

Does this plan sound good to you? If so, we can begin with the first step: creating the `Dockerfile`.
